# Exam-Timetable-Generator-
Exam Timetable Generator (Dec 2024): Developed a web-based app to generate optimized exam timetables based on constraints like room availability, instructor schedules, and course conflicts. Used a greedy algorithm for scheduling and built the UI with HTML, CSS, React, TypeScript, and JavaScript, boosting efficiency and reducing errors.
